# Rikkyu (リッキュー)

> I love Japanese Name, but I am not Japanese.

Rikkyu is a compiler set of Esolang (Esoteric Programming Language), including the Interpreter / Compiler for:

- Befunge (Support Befunge-93)
- Brainfuck
- Chicken
- Chef
- FRACTRAN
- GolfScript
- INTERCAL
- LOLCODE
- Unlambda
- Whitespace

Rikkyu is written in C++. So you need CMake and any of C++ Compiler that **Support C++17 or above** (I recommend GCC or Clang).

⚠ **I will not backport this project to C++14/11/03/98.**  
However, if I ever feel like it, I *might* consider it in the future.

Have fun!
