Rikkyu is a compiler set of Esolang (Esoteric Programming Language), including the Interpreter / Compiler for:

- Befunge (Support Befunge-93)
- Brainfuck
- Chicken
- Chef
- FRACTRAN
- GolfScript
- INTERCAL
- LOLCODE
- Unlambda
- Whitespace

Rikkyu is written in C++. So you need CMake and any of C++ Compiler (I recommend GCC or Clang).

Have fun!
